A normally-balanced die (with six faces) is thrown 10,000 times. Among these 10,000 throws, 1,000 are taken at random.

We carry out this experiment five times, and we write down m, the average number of times we get the number six out of the 10,000 throws, and n, the average number of times we get the number four in the subsample.
